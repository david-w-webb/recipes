Ingredients per serving:
 - 1/2 pounds salmon fillet (with skin)
 - 1/2 cup water
 - 1/2 cup olive oil
 - 1 tbsp grapeseed oil 
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp lemon pepper seasoning
 - 1/2 cup couscous

Directions:
 1. Preheat large cast-iron skillet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper on medium-low for 5 minutes 
 2. While heating the pan, oil the salmon on all sides with 1 tsp grapeseed oil.
 3. Coat the top of the aluminum foil or parchement paper lining the pan with the remaining 2 tsb grapeseed oil
 4. Place the salmon on the aluminum foil or parchment paper skin-down and sprinkle with salt and lemon pepper seasoning.
 5. Set a timer for 7 minutes to check on the salmon.
 6. Mix the water, olive oil, some of the remaining salt, and some of the remaining lemon pepper seasoning in a 
    microwave-safe bowl and boil in the microwave (2 minutes on high)
 7. Remove the water/oil/seasoning mix from the microwave and add the couscous.  Stir and fluff repeatedly.  Keep covered until ready to serve.
 8. When the timer sounds, use a spatula to cut the salmon across the lateral line.  Check for doneness and add additional time as needed until cooked.
 9. Spread the couscous on the bottom of a plate.  Using the spatula, separate the salmon meat from the skin (the skin will stick to the foil) and 
    sever the meat on top of the couscous.
 10. Enjoy!
